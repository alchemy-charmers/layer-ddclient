summary: address updating utility for dynamic DNS services
maintainer: Chris Sanders <sanders.chris@gmail.com>
description: |
  This package provides a client to update dynamic IP addresses with
  several dynamic DNS service providers, such as DynDNS.com.  This makes
  it possible to use a fixed hostname (such as myhost.dyndns.org) to
  access a machine with a dynamic IP address.  This client supports both
  dynamic and (near) static services, as  well as MX record and
  alternative name management. It caches the address, and only attempts
  the update when it has changed.
